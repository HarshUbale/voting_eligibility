# voting_eligibility
The Voting Eligibility App is a Java-based console application designed to determine if a user is eligible to vote based on age and citizenship criteria.
* Age Verification: Prompts users to enter their date of birth and calculates their age to ensure they meet the minimum voting age requirement.
* Citizenship Check: Requires users to specify their citizenship status to confirm eligibility.
* Eligibility Status: Provides a clear message indicating whether the user meets the criteria to vote or if they need to fulfill additional requirements.
This project demonstrates core Java programming skills, including input handling, conditionals, and basic date operations, to create a functional tool for verifying voting eligibility.
